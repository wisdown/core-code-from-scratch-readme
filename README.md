*Both the Interpreter and the compiler are used to convert the syntax of programming languages to language that the machine or binary although they have clear differences as.*
  - An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a given programming language.
  - A compiler is a program that converts the source code of a program to its equivalent in another lower-level programming language.

ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language.*

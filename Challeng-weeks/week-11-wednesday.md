<summary>What is an API?</summary>
<p align = justify>
a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

<summary>What is a Protocol?</summary>
<p align = justify>
protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it.

<details>
<summary>Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet? </summary>
<p align = justify>
They are also used at the managerial level.

example:
The API allows a company to access the data and functionality of your application to third-party developers of third-party, internal units, and business partners. This allows products and services, to communicate with and control the data and the functionality of others through an interface that is documented.

<details>
<summary>Why is structured communication between two programs important? </summary>
<p align = justify>

- Using structure when communicating is important for interacting and building relationships with others. Using structured techniques can also help you improve your ability to provide input and understand complex topics. Additionally, structured communicating can support a wide range of processes in business

1. Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?

- As its translation describes that it is a set of functions and procedures which allow integrating systems, we can say that the communication is an api.

### From JSON to REST

<!-- start area -->

<ol>
<li>
<details>
<summary> What is HTTP?</summary>
<p align = justify>
HTTP is an application layer protocol in the seven-layer OSI networking model, which standardizes the communication functions of telecommunications or computing systems regardless of the underlying internal structure and technology. 
</p>
</detatils>

<li>
<details>
<summary> What is JSON?</summary>
<p align = justify>

JSON (JavaScript object Notation) is a data exchange lightweight format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate

1. Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?

    - it can be said that it is an object that has ordered pairs
</p>

<details>
<summary> What is REST? </summary>
<p align = justify>

REST is an interface to connect multiple systems based on the HTTP protocol

1. Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?

    - Is a architecture pattern

<details>
<summary> What is a Resource in REST? </summary>
<p align = justify>
The resources are the nouns of the Web: describe any object, document, or thing that you may need to store or send to other services.

1. What is a resource identifier?

    - A REST API is modeled as collections of resources affordable individual (the nouns of the API). Reference is made to the resource with its resource names, and are manipulated by using a small set of methods (also known as operations or verbs

<details>
<summary> What is an HTTP method? </summary>
<p align = justify>
The HTTP protocol defines eight "verbs" by which a web client can request to retrieve, update or manage content from a web server resource. These eight types of HTTP requests are known as HTTP Request Methods, and these include

1. What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?

    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - PATCH

2. Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?

    - The main methods supported by HTTP and therefore used by a REST API are: POST: create a new resource. PUT: to modify an existing resource. GET: consult information of a resource

<details>
<summary>Is REST the same as HTTP?</summary>
<p align = justify>
NO IT ISN'T

- REST is an interface and html is a protocol

<details>
<summary>Answer the questions:  </summary>
<p align = justify>

1. Postman only works with REST APIs?
    - yes, since it only allows us to perform API tests. It is an HTTP client that gives us the possibility to test 'HTTP requests' through a graphical user interface
2. Is there an alternative to Postman?

    - SoapUI
    - Mockoon
    - WSO2 API Manager
    - Zapier
    - APPSeCONNECT

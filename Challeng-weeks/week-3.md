<h2>Week Goals</h2>

## Monday

Excrcise Name: Who Likes It?

- How i fixed: I decided to use the known methods to reinforce knowledge
  methord used length , if, tamplates. and variebles overload
- other consideration: when we used the length method,
  if an array is empty it returns 0

```javascript Exercise No. 1
function likes(names) {
  let size = names.length;
  let msm = "";
  if (size === 0) {
    msm = "no one likes this";
  }
  if (size === 1) {
    msm = `${names[size - 1]} likes this`;
  }
  if (size === 2) {
    msm = `${names[0]} and ${names[size - 1]} like this`;
  }
  if (size === 3) {
    msm = `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
  }
  if (size > 3) {
    msm = `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${size - 2} others like this`;
  }

  return msm;
}
```
